RAM-SCB output can be visualized in a number of different ways depending on
the user's tastes and preferences.  However, a standard library for opening,
manipulating, and plotting exists as a sub-module of Spacepy.  Users may
find this freely available Python library at
\href{http://spacepy.lanl.gov/}{spacepy.lanl.gov}.  Alternatively,
development versions can be obtained via the project's
\href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/spacepy/}{Source Forge} page.  The
RAM-SCB module is nested under {\tt spacepy.pybats.ram}.

Stand-alone code snippets for both Python and Matlab can be found in the
{viz} directories.  These routines are largely out-of-date and not maintained.
We recommend caution when using them.
